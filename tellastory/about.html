    <h1> What is sign stealing? </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> In baseball, sign stealing is a method where the team that is batting figures out what pitch the pitcher will throw before. For instance, the catcher will show a certain number of fingers to the pitcher (indicating what pitch they want the pitcher to throw). If batters are able to figure out these signs before the pitcher throws, they will be put at a higher advantage to get a hit.

        <br>

        A good example of sign stealing can be shown in this video below.
